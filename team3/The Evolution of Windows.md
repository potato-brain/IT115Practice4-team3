# The Evolution of Windows

## Introduction

The evolution of Microsoft Windows is an interesting journey that began in 1985. Since its initial launch in 1985, Microsoft Windows has undergone nine significant versions. Now, more than 39 years later, the interface of Windows has transformed considerably, yet it retains a sense of familiarity with features that have endured through the years. This evolution has been accompanied by advancements in computing power and, more recently, a transition from traditional keyboard and mouse usage to touchscreen technology.

## Windows 1
This is where it all started for Windows. The original Windows 1 was released in November 1985 and was Microsoft’s first true attempt at a graphical user interface in 16-bit. Windows 1.0, a graphical user interface (GUI) for MS-DOS, was a modest start, featuring simple applications like Paint and Notepad.

## Windows 2
Two years after the release of Windows 1, Microsoft’s Windows 2 replaced it in December 1987. The big innovation for Windows 2 was that windows could overlap each other, and it also introduced the ability to minimise or maximise windows instead of “iconising” or “zooming”.

## Windows 3
The first Windows that required a hard drive launched in 1990. Windows 3 was the first version to see more widespread success and be considered a challenger to Apple’s Macintosh and the Commodore Amiga graphical user interfaces, coming pre-installed on computers from PC-compatible manufacturers including Zenith Data Systems.

## Windows 3.1
Windows 1 and 2 both had point release updates, but Windows 3.1 released in 1992 is notable because it introduced TrueType fonts making Windows a viable publishing platform for the first time.

## Windows 95
The mid-90s saw the release of Windows 95, a groundbreaking version that integrated the Start menu and taskbar, revolutionizing user interaction. Following this, Windows 98 and Windows ME (Millennium Edition) brought enhancements in hardware support and internet integration.

## Windows 98
Released in June 1998, Windows 98 built on Windows 95 and brought with it IE 4, Outlook Express, Windows Address Book, Microsoft Chat and NetShow Player, which was replaced by Windows Media Player 6.2 in Windows 98 Second Edition in 1999.

## Windows ME
Considered a low point in the Windows series by many – at least, until they saw Windows Vista – Windows Millennium Edition was the last Windows to be based on MS-DOS, and the last in the Windows 9x line.

## Windows 2000
The enterprise twin of ME, Windows 2000 was released in February 2000 and was based on Microsoft’s business-orientated system Windows NT and later became the basis for Windows XP.

## Windows XP
In the early 2000s, Windows XP emerged, known for its stability and user-friendly interface, becoming one of the most beloved versions. 

## Windows Vista
Windows Vista followed in 2007, introducing a new visual style but faced criticism for performance issues.

## Windows 7
Windows 7, released in 2009, rectified many of Vista's shortcomings and became a favorite among users. 

## Windows 8
The introduction of Windows 8 in 2012 marked a significant shift towards touch interfaces, though it received mixed reviews.

## Windows 10
Windows 10, launched in 2015, aimed to unify the experience across devices and introduced features like Cortana and the Edge browser.

## Windows 11
Most recently, Windows 11 released in 2021, offering a fresh design and enhanced productivity features, continuing the legacy of innovation that defines Windows.

## Conclusion
Each version reflects the changing landscape of technology and user needs, showcasing Microsoft's commitment to evolving its operating system. Throughout its history, Windows has maintained a significant market share, largely due to its extensive software ecosystem and compatibility with a wide range of hardware. Today, it remains a leading operating system, continually evolving to meet the needs of users worldwide.
